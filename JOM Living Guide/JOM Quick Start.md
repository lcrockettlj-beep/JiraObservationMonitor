# JOM Quick Start

Jira Observation Monitor (JOM) is a read-only operational console for observing an Atlassian estate through authenticated and runtime-backed authority. This guide records the system as built at branch `main` and commit `29d1166b10da980da847f3ae8978e1191b24b8b9` on 14 August 2026. The repository evidence identifies 184 tracked paths, 67 Python files, 34 HTML templates, 14 JavaScript files and 14 CSS files.

The defining engineering principle is truth before appearance. JOM must not invent a value merely to complete a dashboard. When evidence is absent, the correct output is unavailable. The guide is both a product explanation for non-technical readers and an owner reference for technical maintenance.

## Rules
- No assumptions as truth. If runtime or authenticated authority cannot prove a value, report it as unavailable.
- Do not present placeholders, estimates, screenshots, demonstrations, or stale snapshots as facts.
- User-facing truth must follow the live chain: page, browser code, API route, runtime contract, collector or builder, authenticated Atlassian authority.
- Audit the active owner, route, source and current file before making changes.
- Use single-owner implementation. No patch stacking, wrappers, sidecars, duplicate active pages or hidden overlays.
- Use exact user-provided paths and filenames.
- Deliver complete downloadable packs with extract, install, validate, clean, stage, commit and push workflow.
- Remove temporary packs and transient runtime logs before commit.
- BOOKSYNC is the documentation update gate before every Git save milestone.

## Resume safely
1. Open repository root.
2. Run `git status --short`.
3. Record branch and latest commit.
4. Identify the current workstream.
5. Inspect current owner files before change.
6. Follow Audit -> Build -> Install -> Validate -> Live test -> Clean -> BOOKSYNC -> Stage -> Commit -> Push.
